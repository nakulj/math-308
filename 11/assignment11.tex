\section{Expected Values under the Null}
To win the series after playing $n$ games, the winning team must win 3 of the first $n-1$ games, and then win the last game. Thus, for each team, the probability of winning after playing $n$ games is:\[
	P(n=k)=\binom{k-1}{3} \left(\h\right)^{k-1}\left(\h\right)
\]
However, the probability of $n$ games being played is the probability of \emph{either} team winning after $n$ games. Thus, the p.m.f. of the number of games played, $N$, is twice the function above:\[
	P(N=k)=\binom{k-1}{3} \left(\h\right)^{k-1}
\]
Thus, the expected number of series $N$ won after $k$ games is $P(N_k)\times(\text{number of games played})$. We can then tabulate the expected and observed values:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
$k$ & 4    & 5    & 6      & 7      \\ \midrule
$\ev{N_k}$ & 6.25 & 12.5 & 15.625 & 15.625 \\
$\ov{N_k}$ & 8    & 8    & 10     & 24     \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Hypothesis Testing}
The test statistic $t$ is given by $\sum_{k=4}^7 \frac{(\ov{N_k}-\ev{N_k})^2}{\ev{N_k}}=9.76$. Because $k$ can take on only 4 values, we know that $t\sim\chi^2_3$. Hence, our $p$ value is given by\[
p=
\intg{9.76}{\infty}{
	\frac{e^{-x/2}\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
}{x}
\approx 0.02
\]

Thus, we can reject the null at the 5\% significance level.
