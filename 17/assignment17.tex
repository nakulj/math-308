\subsection{}
The actual mean of the distribution is not random; thus the probability of it being in any interval is necessarily either zero or one, and can never be an intermediate value such as 95\%.
\subsection{}
This is a correct interpretation.
\subsection{}
No, because each sample will generate different 95\% confidence intervals. However, we can be sure that 95\% of these will contain the true mean.
