\subsection{} Suppose that cookie orders are represented such that, for example, an order of 1 sugar, 2 chocolate chips, 0 oatmeal, 0 peanut butter, and 2 ginger snaps is given by $|c|cc|cc|$. Then, two of the bars are fixed, giving the string $|???????|$, where the nine $?$ symbols are to be replaced by five $c$'s and two $|$'s. If we choose $5$ distinct positions in which to place the $c$'s, the positions of the remaining $|$'s is fixed. Thus, the number of possible cookie orders is $\binom{9}{5}$.

\subsection{}
More generally, we can use `cookie types' to represent occurances of particular elements in the chosen sets. Then, fixing the position of two $|$'s leaves $n+1-2=n-1$ $|$'s and  $n$ $c$'s, for a total of $2n-1$ symbols. Picking element members requires $n$ position choices, giving the total number of set choices as $\binom{2n-1}{n}$.

\subsection{}
For a sample $S$ of size $n$, each bootstrap sample represents the choice of $n$ elements from $S$ with replacement. Thus, the number of bootstrap samples is as above $\binom{2n-1}{n}$.

\subsection{}
The number of bootstrap samples with $k_1$ $a_1$'s, $k_2$ $a_2$'s \ldots $k_n$ $a_n$'s is the same as the number of permutations of the string \[
\underbrace{\str{1}\str{2}\ldots \str{n}}_{n \text{ symbols}}
\]
Using the formula for string permuations with repeated characters, this yields \[\frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!\ldots k_n!}\]
which, by definition, equals
\[\binom{n}{k_1,k_2\ldots k_n}\qed\]

\subsection{}
A bootstrap sample with $k_i$ $a_i$'s requires choosing $k_i$ of $n$ positions, after which the remaining $n-k_i$ positions can be filled by any of the remaining $n-1$ elements. Thus, the number of such samples is: \[(n-1)^{n-k_i}\binom{n}{k_i}\]
The total number of bootstrap samples is simply $n^n$. Thus, the required probability is \[
\frac{(n-1)^{n-k_i}}{n^n}\binom{n}{k_i}
\]
